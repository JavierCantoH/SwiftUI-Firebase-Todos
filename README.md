# SwiftUI-Firebase-Todos 📝✅

Welcome to the SwiftUI-Firebase-Todos repository! This repository contains a simple todo list app developed using SwiftUI and Firebase for iOS. 📱✅

## Overview 📝

The SwiftUI-Firebase-Todos app allows users to create and manage their todos in a modern and easy-to-use interface. The app uses Firebase as a backend to store and synchronize todos across multiple devices. 📱🔥

The project includes the following features:

- A modern and user-friendly interface that is easy to use and navigate 📱👀
- Support for creating, updating, and deleting todos ✏️🔄❌
- Real-time synchronization of todos across multiple devices 🔥📲💻
- Integration with Firebase Authentication for user authentication and authorization 🔐

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the SwiftUI-Firebase-Todos app, you need to set up a Firebase project and configure the Firebase SDK in Xcode. You can then clone this repository, add your Firebase configuration file, and run the app in the iOS Simulator or on a physical iOS device. 🛠️📱

## Usage 🤖

To use the SwiftUI-Firebase-Todos app in your own iOS app, you need to set up a Firebase project and integrate the Firebase SDK in your Xcode project. You can then copy the necessary files from this repository and modify the code to fit your needs. The project is designed to be modular and customizable, so you can easily add or remove features as needed. 📝🎨

## Credits 🙌

The SwiftUI-Firebase-Todos app was created by [Javier Canto](https://github.com/JavierCantoH) as a demonstration of SwiftUI and Firebase integration.
